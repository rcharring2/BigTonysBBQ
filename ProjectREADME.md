This is a website for a fictitious restaurant that was created in a web development class I am taking. The CSS comes mostly from a tamplate retrieved from HTML5up.com.

The main purpose of this project was to get experience using javascript and jquery. 

Please note that the links for the social media sites will only take you back t the top of the page. I did not create social media sites for the restaurant since it is not a real restaurant.

Enjoy!
